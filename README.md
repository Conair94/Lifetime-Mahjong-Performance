# Lifetime-Mahjong-Performance
Most fridays I play mahjong with my friends for penny a point stakes. Here is out lifetime performance and payout data. 

## Current Performance 
Big props to Helio for crushing it during the October games, and being our current leader.

Big props to Sam for continuing to play with us.

## Rules
We play MCR rules with a few house rules that add some scoring rules:
1. If you win a fully concealed vertically symmetric hand and simultaneously flip your entire stack of 14 tiles 180 degrees to face the table without dropping any tiles it becomes a limit hand.
2. If you win on replacement once its 8 Fan, twice is 24 Fan, thrice is Limit.
3. If you win on replacement AND the winning tile is a 1 dot or 5 dot, then this is a Limit hand.
